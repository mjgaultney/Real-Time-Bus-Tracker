# Real Time Bus Tracker

<h3>To run this project: </h3>
<li>Download the code</li>
<li>run the index.html in your favorite web browser.</li>
<li>move your mouse over the button "Stops between parents house and my house in Dallas"</li>
<li>Enjoy the blue border that appears for a second before clicking the button</li>
<li>Watch the red marker (represents the bus) go from stop to stop to my parents house and back to mine</li>
<li>Take advantage of public transportation</li>

<h2>Project Objective</h3>
This projects was to learn how to use maps as well as customize them by scrubbing data from city bus records. During this project I adjusted the map styling to be "blueprint", changed the font and a few characteristics of the button. I have also changed the color of the marker to be "red".  

<h2>Future updates</h2>
Future improvements would be to have the marker labled with bus details, and if you need to change busses the description would change at that stop.
