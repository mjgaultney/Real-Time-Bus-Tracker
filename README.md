Real Time Bus Tracker

This is a map of the bus stops between my parents house in Dallas and my own house. To begin the route move your mouse over the button and click when you see a blue border appear. This will begin the bus journey between the two houses.

During this project I adjusted the map styling to be "blueprint", changed the font and characteristics of the button.
