# BusTracker
Real Time Bus Tracker

To run this project, download the code and run the index.html in your favorite web browser.

This is a map of the bus stops between my parents house in Dallas and my own house. To begin the route move your mouse over the button and click when you see a blue border appear. This will begin the bus journey between the two houses.

During this project I adjusted the map styling to be "blueprint", changed the font and a few characteristics of the button. I have also changed the color of the marker to be "red".  

Future improvements would be to have the marker labled with bus details, and if you need to change busses the description would change at that stop.
